# TipCollector

A little project I am completing to help further my knowledge of TypeScript, .Net, C# and ASPNET Core tools. The idea is to allow the user to create an account and then store logs of their earnings by each shift. The idea came to me because I often have a hard time tracking all my earnings for a given week once I recieve my paystub.
